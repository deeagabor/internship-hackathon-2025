How To Prepare for the presentation

Prepare your app running locally and use a very small model so that it runs the code review as fast as possible (for Ollama we recommend qwen2.5:0.5b)

Prepare a piece of demo code that has 1-2 issues that you will execute your tool on.

You will be asked to showcase how you are using a local LLM.

Next you will be able to show how you provide a custom coding guideline that will impact the findings and also showcase the comment/reply functions and RUN the code review again and showcase the functionality.
